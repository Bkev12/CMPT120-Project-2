Welcome. Its appears that you are in a jungle where you begin the game with a psychotic demonized gorilla, obsessively running after you trying to eliminate your soul. Since you are afraid to die you decide to a run for your life. "All you have to do, is try and stay alive as long as possible." Good luck!!!!
